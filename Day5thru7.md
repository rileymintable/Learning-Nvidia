---DECEMBER 28, 2024 UPDATE---
<p>Between Christmas and family functions, "Learning Nvidia" has taken a backseat. Nevertheless I have made strides in establishing my development environment. 

Fully dual-booted now with proper 2 TB Windows and 1 TB Ubuntu. Windows gets the bigger drive to store large 3D files, USD formats, and experimental games. 

VR headset is plush with the Bobo headset addition. Very fun and practical use case for VR gaming and the expabded battery pack really adds wonders to longevity. 
MSFS 2024 is also fully installed with VR set up. Graphics are STUNNING  with the beastly 4090RTX and it truly ius the most immersive and stunning VR experience I have had to date. 

Now on to truly setting up the NVIDIA OMNIVERSE enivironment to see about setting up my little grocery store idea. 

Maybe I'll get better at HTML along the way? </p>
