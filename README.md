# Learning-Nvidia
Follow me on my journey to understand the insane word of Nvidia, CUDA, Omniverse, OpenUSD, and more!

The goal of this repository is to provide a cohesive list of educational content for myself and others who are interested in flexing their GPU's muscle. I do not have a specific end goal in mind, beyond some asthetic designs, and this repo will act as a living document to track my research. I am horrible at documenting!! Please feel free to collab, share ideas, and pass on your specific knowledge (blessings!). 


I will begin by starting with a solid foundation from Nvidia themselves via their Self-Paced programs designed to familiarize users with their architecture/multiverse(s). 

You can follow along here --> <a>https://learn.nvidia.com/en-us/training/self-paced-courses</a>

I am by no means an expert designer nor programmer...yet! The daily search persists. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this and happy hunting!
