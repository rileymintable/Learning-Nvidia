# Learning-Nvidia
Follow me on my journey to understand the insane word of Nvidia, CUDA, Omniverse, OpenUSD, and more!

The goal of this repository is to provide a cohesive list for myself and others who are interested in flexing their GPU's muscle. I do not have a specific end goal in mind, beyond some asthetic designs, and this repo will act as a living document to track my research. I am horrible at documenting!! Please feel free to colllab, share ideas, and pass on your specific knowledge (blessings!).
