Day 3 and 4: 

Rebuilt PC to following hardware:

<code>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3d
GPU: Nvidia 4090 RTX
MOBO: Asus Tuf Gaming x670e
RAM: CORSAIR Vengance 64GB DDR5 XRP
Cheap $80 water cooler</code>

Had issues with initial motherboard, Tomahawk x670e. Red CPU light persisted and yellow DRAM light. Basic troubleshooting and "by the manual" setup was poor.
No power out --> to USB hub either on Tomahawk. 
Memory retrain (two hours) occurred to no success.
Swapped MOBO and a quick 5 min retrain worked as expected with Tuf Gaming MOBO. 

Nvidia "Kit" boots as expected with minorly concerning flags. 

Not a fun day but we have the tools to move forward now with our education. 
Best to get all the hardware now before the tariffs or UFO's or whatever happens rolls in next year.
